Modular Kotlin/Java Library Gradle Project
==========================================

How to set up a Gradle project that uses JPMS modules and that can be used for mixed Kotlin/Java coding.

**JPMS = Java Platform Module System** (introduced with Java 9, aka "Project Jigsaw")

Versions Used
-------------

- Gradle 8.6
- Kotlin 1.9.20
- Java 21
- IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.5, Build #IU-233.14808.21, built on March 12, 2024

Gradle (Step 1)
---------------

```
mkdir jpms-library
cd jpms-library/
```

Set JAVA_HOME to the desired JDK.

Generate multi-project build with `./gradlew init --package com.staticnoiselog`:

- type of project: library
- implementation language: Kotlin
- build script DSL: Kotlin
- project name: jpms-library

This way of project initialization should already use a `toolchain` in the build script.

    ./gradlew clean build

IntelliJ (Step 2)
-----------------

Open project in IntelliJ.
Check/fix the project SDK version.

### First Module

First we convert the existing "lib" into a JPMS module.

Unfortunately, the `module-info.java` only seems to work if it is in the `src/main/java` directory. So we have to create
that directory first.

In IntelliJ, right-click on `src/main`, New, Directory
-> IntelliJ offers "Gradle Source Sets java". Select this.

Right-click on the newly created `java` subdirectory, New, `module-info.java`

Choose a good name for the first module as this how your library will be seen by
users. The "kotlin.stdlib" module is required.

    module jpms.library.lib {
        requires kotlin.stdlib;
    }

### Add Second Module

To add a second module we have to add a Gradle subproject and convert that into a JPMS module, too.

**In IntelliJ:**

- Right-click on the project's root directory: New, Module...
- Prefer underscores for the name of modules: long_module_name
  (dashes are technically OK, but snake_case is preferable for subdirectories)
- Language: Kotlin
- Build System: Gradle
- JDK: the actual JDK you are using for your project
- Gradle DSL: Kotlin
- Under "Advanced Settings" you can change "GroupId" to set a package name.
- Ignore a possible warning "Unsupported Project JDK" and proceed.

Use `build.gradle.kts` build script of the first module created by Gradle as a template for adapting the new
module's `build.gradle.kts` generated by IntelliJ. In particular, replace `kotlin("jvm") version "1.9.20"` with
`alias(libs.plugins.jvm)` in order to make use of `libs.versions.toml` and make sure to add the `java-library` plugin.

Note how an additional `include` was added to `settings.gradle.kts` for the new module.

Now we convert this new module into a JPMS module. Just as with the first module, we have to create `module-info.java`
in the `src/main/java` directory. So we have to create that directory first.

In IntelliJ, right-click on `src/main`, New, Directory
-> IntelliJ offers "Gradle Source Sets java". Select this.

Right-click on the newly created `java` subdirectory, New, `module-info.java`

    module jpms.library.deeplearning {
        requires kotlin.stdlib;
    }

**Manually:**

- create directory for new module
- create directory structure with src/main/kotlin and src/main/java
- add new module to `settings.gradle.kts` (`include("deeplearning")`)
- copy over `build.gradle.kts` from an existing module

**Referring to the Second Module from the First Module**

In `build.gradle.kts` of the first module, add the following line to the dependencies:

    implementation(project(":deeplearning"))

### Renaming a Module

Status IntelliJ 2023.2.5:

- Right-click the module in IntelliJ, Refactor, Rename..., Rename module
- Ignore errors
- Manually rename the Gradle subproject in `settings.gradle.kts`
- "Reload All Gradle Projects" with the button in the Gradle window

### Deleting a Module

Status IntelliJ 2023.2.5:

- Navigate to IntelliJ's Project Structure (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S)
- Delete the module (in Project Settings, Modules)
- Manually delete the directory
- Manually remove the subproject from `settings.gradle.kts`
- "Reload All Gradle Projects" with the button in the Gradle window

### Troubleshooting

If the build produces errors for `module-info.java` like "package is empty or does not exist", try adding some dummy
Java file in the `src/main/java` directory of the module.
